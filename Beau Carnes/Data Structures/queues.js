// ==== QUEUES ====

// You can think of a queue as a line of people at a grocery store.
// The first one in the line is the first one to be served.
// A queue is considered FIFO (First In First Out).
// This means that once a new element is added, all elements that were added before have to be removed before the new element can be removed.
// A queue has just two main operations: enqueue and dequeue. Enqueue means to insert an item into the back of the queue and dequeue means removing the front item.
